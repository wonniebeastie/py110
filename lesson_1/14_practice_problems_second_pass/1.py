fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "banana")

# How would you count the number of occurrences of "banana" in the tuple?

print(fruits.count("banana")) # 2

# You can count the number of times `"banana"` appears in the `fruits` tuple
# by using the `count` tuple method. It returns the number of times a value
# occurs in a tuple.
