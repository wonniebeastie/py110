# What is the return value of the list comprehension below? 
# Try to answer without running the code.
uh_huh = [num for num in [1, 2, 3] if num > 1]

# This uses filtering to select for integers in the list that is greater than
# 1 to add them to the new list.
# So it will be:
# [2, 3]

print(uh_huh) # [2, 3]
